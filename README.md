# Gameboy Emulator

## Compilation

### Linux
Install the SDL3 development library (```sudo dnf install SDL3-devel``` on fedora, for example) and run ```./run.sh``` to compile (gcc) and run.

### Windows
[Download the VC version of SDL3-devel](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases), rename the the SDL3-*version_number* (e.g. SDL3-3.2.16) folder that's inside it to **SDL3-win**, and then copy SDL3-win to gameboy_emu. Run ```run.bat``` to compile (MSVC) and run.
